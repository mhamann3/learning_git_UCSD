#Git Basics

git init 		-- create a new git repo in current folder
git status 	-- shows the current status of changes and staged commits in the working directory
git add		-- Place one or more files in the staging area
git commit	-- Commit staged changes to the git repo





git log		-- displays the repo commit history in reverse chronological order
git checkout	-- returns a file to its state at the time of the last commit
				This can be used to checkout even older versions
git diff		-- shows what differs between the current state of the files and what their status on the last committed version
